            I belong to Ma’am Jenny Timbal’s CC 111 class, in section T171 for
            the 1st Semester of SY 2023 - 2024.

            Math definitely isn’t my strong suit. I was having trouble with the
            conversions. I know how to do it, but I take a lot longer than
            others. My classmates flocked over to help me, which I’m grateful
            for, but I was already overwhelmed and they all kept talking at once
            — I got overstimulated and started crying!

            I was very anxious about the test because I thought there would be
            binary, turns out it was all just things I already knew.

            My group mates stayed at my house for two days, going home at 9pm
            and 10pm respectively to make our first ever presentation. Ma’am
            said we did too much.

            Ma’am didn’t have the time to teach us the basics in person, so we
            had to study on our own. This was a very daunting task, but we had
            to go through with it anyway.
